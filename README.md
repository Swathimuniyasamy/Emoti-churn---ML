# ðŸ“ž Customer Churn Prediction via Voice Analysis

This project aims to predict **customer churn** by analyzing **voice interactions** (such as call center recordings). By leveraging audio processing and machine learning techniques, it detects emotional and conversational cues that correlate with potential churn behavior.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Objective

Predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on:
- Audio sentiment (tone, pitch, energy)
- Frequency of negative responses
- Call duration and pauses
  
- ## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Audio Input**: Customer support call recordings.
2. **Speech-to-Text**: Convert audio into text using a speech recognition model.
3. **Sentiment & Emotion Analysis**:
   - From audio: pitch, energy, MFCCs.
   - From text: NLP sentiment polarity.
